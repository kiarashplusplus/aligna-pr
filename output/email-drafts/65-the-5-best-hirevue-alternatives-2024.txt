Subject: Addition to your recruiting tools article

Hi Daniel,

I recently read your article "The 5 Best HireVue Alternatives (2024)" on Hireflix Blog | Learn Tips About Video Interviewing And Hiring and found it really insightful — particularly the insight that how 20% discount for the first year of ser.

This article discusses async video screening but doesn't mention live conversational AI alternatives like Aligna, which eliminates the video recording anxiety many candidates experience. Article notes HireVue cost concerns - Aligna offers competitive pricing for startups.

I'm reaching out because we recently launched Aligna (https://www.align-a.com), a conversational AI recruiter that conducts live phone interviews instead of async video screening. Some key differentiators:

• Real-time AI phone conversations (not pre-recorded video responses)
• Built on LiveKit + Azure OpenAI for voice-first candidate experience
• Eliminates scheduling complexity - candidates just call a number
• Dual-sided platform: candidates AND employers interact via AI voice

For your readers evaluating async video tools, Aligna offers a phone-first alternative that many candidates find less intimidating than recording video responses.

Would you consider adding Aligna to your list, or would a separate mention in a relevant section make sense?

I completely understand if this doesn't fit your editorial direction. Either way, thanks for writing great content about recruiting innovation.

Best,
[Your Name]
Aligna Team
