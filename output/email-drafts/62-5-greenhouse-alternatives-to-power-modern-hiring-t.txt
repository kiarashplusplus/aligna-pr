Subject: New alternative for your recruiting platform comparison

Hi Unknown,

I recently read your article "5 Greenhouse Alternatives to Power Modern Hiring Teams" on Lever and found it really insightful — particularly the balanced analysis that helps readers make informed decisions.

The article discusses scheduling challenges in recruiting but doesn't mention phone-first AI screening that eliminates scheduling entirely - candidates just call a number anytime.

I'm reaching out because we recently launched Aligna (https://www.align-a.com), a conversational AI recruiter that conducts live phone interviews instead of async video screening. Some key differentiators:

• Real-time AI phone conversations (not pre-recorded video responses)
• Built on LiveKit + Azure OpenAI for voice-first candidate experience
• Eliminates scheduling complexity - candidates just call a number
• Dual-sided platform: candidates AND employers interact via AI voice

Since your article highlights scheduling challenges, Aligna's approach of 'call anytime' might resonate with your audience - no booking required.

Would it make sense to add Aligna as an alternative in your comparison, especially in a 'live voice AI' category?

I completely understand if this doesn't fit your editorial direction. Either way, thanks for writing great content about recruiting innovation.

Best,
[Your Name]
Aligna Team
