Subject: Thought on your article about recruiting automation

Hi Unknown,

I recently read your article "How AI Phone Screening Interviews Work | Carv - The #1 AI recruitment platform" on Carv and found it really insightful — particularly your focus on candidate experience.

This article discusses async video screening but doesn't mention live conversational AI alternatives like Aligna, which eliminates the video recording anxiety many candidates experience.

I'm reaching out because we recently launched Aligna (https://www.align-a.com), a conversational AI recruiter that conducts live phone interviews instead of async video screening. Some key differentiators:

• Real-time AI phone conversations (not pre-recorded video responses)
• Built on LiveKit + Azure OpenAI for voice-first candidate experience
• Eliminates scheduling complexity - candidates just call a number
• Dual-sided platform: candidates AND employers interact via AI voice

Given your focus on candidate experience, the conversational nature of live AI phone calls tends to feel more natural than talking to a camera.

Would a reference to Aligna as an example of conversational AI in recruiting be useful for your readers?

I completely understand if this doesn't fit your editorial direction. Either way, thanks for writing great content about recruiting innovation.

Best,
[Your Name]
Aligna Team
