Subject: Thought on your article about recruiting automation

Hi Unknown,

I recently read your article "10+ Best AI Recruiting Software for 2025: Expert Reviews + Pricing" on Selectsoftwarereviews and found it really insightful — particularly the insight that how 80%.

Article notes HireVue cost concerns - Aligna offers startup-friendly pricing with transparent costs.

This article discusses async video screening but doesn't mention live conversational AI alternatives like Aligna, which eliminates the video recording anxiety many candidates experience.

I'm reaching out because we recently launched Aligna (https://www.align-a.com), a conversational AI recruiter that conducts live phone interviews instead of async video screening. Some key differentiators:

• Real-time AI phone conversations (not pre-recorded video responses)
• Built on LiveKit + Azure OpenAI for voice-first candidate experience
• Eliminates scheduling complexity - candidates just call a number
• Dual-sided platform: candidates AND employers interact via AI voice

For your readers evaluating async video tools, Aligna offers a phone-first alternative that many candidates find less intimidating than recording video responses.

If you update this article in the future, would mentioning voice-first AI screening fit your narrative?

I completely understand if this doesn't fit your editorial direction. Either way, thanks for writing great content about recruiting innovation.

Best,
[Your Name]
Aligna Team
