Subject: Thought on your article about recruiting automation

Hi Unknown,

I recently read your article "Introduction | LiveKit docs" on LiveKit docs and found it really insightful — especially your thoughtful analysis of AI's role in recruiting.

This technical article could benefit from a real-world case study of LiveKit in production for voice-based recruiting automation.

I'm reaching out because we recently launched Aligna (https://www.align-a.com), a conversational AI recruiter that conducts live phone interviews instead of async video screening. Some key differentiators:

• Real-time AI phone conversations (not pre-recorded video responses)
• Built on LiveKit + Azure OpenAI for voice-first candidate experience
• Eliminates scheduling complexity - candidates just call a number
• Dual-sided platform: candidates AND employers interact via AI voice

For technical recruiting (which your article focuses on), our open-source approach and MIT founder background might add credibility.

Would a reference to Aligna as an example of conversational AI in recruiting be useful for your readers?

I completely understand if this doesn't fit your editorial direction. Either way, thanks for writing great content about recruiting innovation.

Best,
[Your Name]
Aligna Team
