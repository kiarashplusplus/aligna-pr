Subject: Addition to your recruiting tools article

Hi Colin,

I recently read your article "Top 21 Recruitment Automation Tools in 2025 | Recruiters LineUp" on Recruiters LineUp and found it really insightful — particularly the insight that how 78% in time-to-hire and 65% in cost-to.

This article discusses async video screening but doesn't mention live conversational AI alternatives like Aligna, which eliminates the video recording anxiety many candidates experience.

I'm reaching out because we recently launched Aligna (https://www.align-a.com), a conversational AI recruiter that conducts live phone interviews instead of async video screening. Some key differentiators:

• Real-time AI phone conversations (not pre-recorded video responses)
• Built on LiveKit + Azure OpenAI for voice-first candidate experience
• Eliminates scheduling complexity - candidates just call a number
• Dual-sided platform: candidates AND employers interact via AI voice

Since your article highlights scheduling challenges, Aligna's approach of 'call anytime' might resonate with your audience - no booking required.

Would you consider adding Aligna to your list, or would a separate mention in a relevant section make sense?

I completely understand if this doesn't fit your editorial direction. Either way, thanks for writing great content about recruiting innovation.

Best,
[Your Name]
Aligna Team
