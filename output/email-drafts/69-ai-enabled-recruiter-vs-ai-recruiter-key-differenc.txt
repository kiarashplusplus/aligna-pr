Subject: New alternative for your recruiting platform comparison

Hi Unknown,

I recently read your article "AI-Enabled Recruiter vs AI Recruiter: Key Differences | Carv - The #1 AI recruitment platform" on Carv and found it really insightful — particularly your perspective on the future of your profession.

This article discusses async video screening but doesn't mention live conversational AI alternatives like Aligna, which eliminates the video recording anxiety many candidates experience.

I'm reaching out because we recently launched Aligna (https://www.align-a.com), a conversational AI recruiter that conducts live phone interviews instead of async video screening. Some key differentiators:

• Real-time AI phone conversations (not pre-recorded video responses)
• Built on LiveKit + Azure OpenAI for voice-first candidate experience
• Eliminates scheduling complexity - candidates just call a number
• Dual-sided platform: candidates AND employers interact via AI voice

Since your article highlights scheduling challenges, Aligna's approach of 'call anytime' might resonate with your audience - no booking required.

Would it make sense to add Aligna as an alternative in your comparison, especially in a 'live voice AI' category?

I completely understand if this doesn't fit your editorial direction. Either way, thanks for writing great content about recruiting innovation.

Best,
[Your Name]
Aligna Team
