Subject: Voice AI perspective for your recruiting guide

Hi Tsahi,

I recently read your article "How to impress WebRTC recruiters" on BlogGeek.me and found it really insightful — especially the practical, actionable framework you've outlined.

This technical article could benefit from a real-world case study of LiveKit in production for voice-based recruiting automation.

I'm reaching out because we recently launched Aligna (https://www.align-a.com), a conversational AI recruiter that conducts live phone interviews instead of async video screening. Some key differentiators:

• Real-time AI phone conversations (not pre-recorded video responses)
• Built on LiveKit + Azure OpenAI for voice-first candidate experience
• Eliminates scheduling complexity - candidates just call a number
• Dual-sided platform: candidates AND employers interact via AI voice

For technical recruiting (which your article focuses on), our open-source approach and MIT founder background might add credibility.

If you update this article in the future, would mentioning voice-first AI screening fit your narrative?

I completely understand if this doesn't fit your editorial direction. Either way, thanks for writing great content about recruiting innovation.

Best,
[Your Name]
Aligna Team
