Subject: Voice AI perspective for your recruiting guide

Hi Unknown,

I recently read your article "The Best AI Recruiting Platforms (The Ultimate Extremely Detailed Guide)" on Herohunt Ai and found it really insightful — particularly the insight that how 50% by quickly zeroing in on high-fit.

Article mentions HireVue feels impersonal/robotic - Aligna uses live AI conversations that feel more natural than recording videos to a screen.

This article discusses async video screening but doesn't mention live conversational AI alternatives like Aligna, which eliminates the video recording anxiety many candidates experience.

I'm reaching out because we recently launched Aligna (https://www.align-a.com), a conversational AI recruiter that conducts live phone interviews instead of async video screening. Some key differentiators:

• Real-time AI phone conversations (not pre-recorded video responses)
• Built on LiveKit + Azure OpenAI for voice-first candidate experience
• Eliminates scheduling complexity - candidates just call a number
• Dual-sided platform: candidates AND employers interact via AI voice

For your readers evaluating async video tools, Aligna offers a phone-first alternative that many candidates find less intimidating than recording video responses.

Would a reference to Aligna as an example of conversational AI in recruiting be useful for your readers?

I completely understand if this doesn't fit your editorial direction. Either way, thanks for writing great content about recruiting innovation.

Best,
[Your Name]
Aligna Team
