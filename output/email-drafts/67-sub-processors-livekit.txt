Subject: Addition to your recruiting tools article

Hi Unknown,

I recently read your article "Sub-processors | LiveKit" on Livekit and found it really insightful — especially the structured comparison format that makes it easy for readers to evaluate options.

This list of recruiting tools doesn't include voice-based AI screeners, which represent the newest generation of candidate assessment technology.

I'm reaching out because we recently launched Aligna (https://www.align-a.com), a conversational AI recruiter that conducts live phone interviews instead of async video screening. Some key differentiators:

• Real-time AI phone conversations (not pre-recorded video responses)
• Built on LiveKit + Azure OpenAI for voice-first candidate experience
• Eliminates scheduling complexity - candidates just call a number
• Dual-sided platform: candidates AND employers interact via AI voice

Given your focus on recruiting innovation, this might be a useful addition for your readers exploring modern screening approaches.

Would you consider adding Aligna to your list, or would a separate mention in a relevant section make sense?

I completely understand if this doesn't fit your editorial direction. Either way, thanks for writing great content about recruiting innovation.

Best,
[Your Name]
Aligna Team
